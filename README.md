# Snake

#### Simple snake game made for fun using sdl and simple c++

To build:
you need qt to be installed for the qmake build system
also on windows you need o modify the path of sdl library
in project file (Snake.pro) to your path of sdl.
on linux I used pkg-config so it should work in most distros(I hope).
